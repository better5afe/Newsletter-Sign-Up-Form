## Overview

This is a simple project which allows users to type in their email address to sign up for a newsletter.

Summary:
- Upon submit, the form is checked by a custom hook which vefifies value provided in the input.
- If an email is successfully submitted, it's saved within the Local Storage.
- Users will receive an appropriate error message in the following scenarios: 
  - The input is empty.
  - Provided value is not a valid email address.
  - The email has already been provided and it's present in the Local Storage.
- The validity check is slighly delayed using a setTimeout() method which imitates sending a request to an external server and allows users to see a loading modal.
- Loading modal is rendered in a separate div using React Portal.
- Application state is managed by React Context.
- users can view the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size as well as see hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page.
